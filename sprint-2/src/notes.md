To do:

- Figure out funciton on componentdidMount() that will fetch axios data and re-render page IF state is not equal to the state I want with that ID.
- Use props.match.url or props.match.path for Links in Aside section.
- Deal with Routing between components in App.js - only then can I match URL or Path.
